<p>-In 1962 hillary Clinton as a teenager wrote to the NASA a letter where she expressed her passion to become an astronaut , and they  discourage her by responding  “ We don’t take girls”. More over  at the age of 27  she was denied the chance of joining the marins pretexting that womans cant see clearly  and are too old .</p><br>
<p>-Loves hot sauce. Clinton uses hot sauce on almost all of her food including salads(She once told the CBS News that she maintains her stamina while on the campaign trail by using hot chilly to keep her metabolism revved up and healthy.)</p><br>
